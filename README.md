# Why?

Well well, I stumbled upon the commercial tool https://www.landbot.io/ and wanted to use it. However the pricing is crazily inhuman, as time of writing, landbot.io would cost you 20€/month which is insane. So I quickly searched the web and quickly found [botui](https://github.com/botui/botui) which is basically what I was searching for. I started using it but figured out that it is overcomplicated: Firstly, for the messages they wrote their own subset of markup language. Why the fudge?… No idea. Secondly, it seems abandonned, it has currently 20 open issues. Lastly, and that was the reason why I did not contribute to the project but wrote my own, it has a dependency to VUE.js! Why in the world would you need a library for this?… Also more specificly requires `vuejs version 2.0.5` a newer version will break the functionality. This is some core desision of the tool I would not want to participate. So here it is, a dead simple landing bot alternative that consists of less than 80 lines of code. Enjoy.
